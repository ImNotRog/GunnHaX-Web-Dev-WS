# GunnHaX Basic Web Dev Workshop

## Setup

If you do not have a code editor, download VSCode [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)! (Even if you do, VSCode is probably better than your existing editor so download it anyways LOL)

Figure out a folder on your computer where you'll do all your stuff.

## React?

If you think your website will need a lot of interactivity, I suggest setting up ReactJS, which is a web technology that makes coding interactivity a LOT easier. (The GunnHacks website was made using React!) If this interests you, check out [this gist](https://gist.github.com/ImNotRog/b832548d492cb1851ee676b9e8f6c1e4).
